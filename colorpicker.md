## [Flex ColorPicker](https://pub.dev/packages/flex_color_picker)

Flex ColorPicker is a customizable color picker for Flutter. The ColorPicker can show six different types of color pickers, three of which are used for the standard Flutter Material colors and their shades. The size and style used for the pick items can be customized.

Flex ColorPicker is available as a published package on [pub.dev here](https://pub.dev/packages/flex_color_picker).

A web demo that shows the features of the ColorPicker [can be tested here](http://rydmike.com/democolorpicker). The source code for this Web ColorPicker demo app [is here](https://github.com/rydmike/color_picker_demo).

The above demo show the web version, but it works very well on mobile devices and Flutter desktop builds too. One advantage of the **Flex ColorPicker** package is that it can be configured in many ways to provide just the right amount of color picking features, with a style that fits your application.
