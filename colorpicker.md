## FlexColorPicker

**FlexColorPicker** is a customizable color picker for Flutter. The ColorPicker can show six different types of 
color pickers, three of which are used for the standard Flutter Material colors and their shades. 
The size and style used for the pick items can be customized.

Flex ColorPicker is available as a [published package on pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/flex_color_picker).

A web demo that shows the features of the color picker [can be tested here](http://rydmike.com/democolorpicker).
The source code for this Web FlexColorPicker demo app [is here](https://github.com/rydmike/color_picker_demo).

The above demo shows the web version, but it works very well on mobile devices and Flutter desktop builds too.
One advantage of the **Flex ColorPicker** package is that it can be configured in many ways to provide just 
the right amount of color picking features, with a style that fits your application.
