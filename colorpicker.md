## FlexColorPicker

**FlexColorPicker** is a highly customizable color picker for Flutter. The color picker can show six different types of 
pickers, three of which are used for the standard Flutter Material colors and their shades. 
The size and style used for the pick items can be customized.

FlexColorPicker is available as a published [**Flutter package**](https://pub.dev/packages/flex_color_picker)
on pub.dev.

A web demo that shows the features of the color picker can be tried [**here**](http://rydmike.com/democolorpicker).
The source code for this Web FlexColorPicker demo app is 
available on [**GitHub**](https://github.com/rydmike/color_picker_demo).

The above demo shows the web version, but it works very well on mobile devices and Flutter desktop builds too.
One feature of the **FlexColorPicker** package is that it can be configured in many ways to provide just 
the right amount of color picking features you need, with a style that fits your application.

**FlexColorPicker** works on all Flutter platforms, Android, iOS, Web, Windows, MacOS and Linux. Here is an
example of the package bundled simple demo application running as a Windows desktop application.
