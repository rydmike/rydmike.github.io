## FlexColorScheme Demo

The FlexColorScheme package can be used to easily create sophisticated **Flutter ColorScheme** based color themes for your app.

The Flexfold web demo app also uses the FlexColorScheme package for its theming. The themes used in the Flexfold demo are available as pre-configured themes when using the FlexColorScheme package. You can of course also easily define and create similar custom themes.

This package is also pending publication, and a simpler example app than the Flexfold demo app.
