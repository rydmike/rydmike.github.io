## [FlexColorScheme](https://pub.dev/packages/flex_color_scheme)

**FlexColorScheme** helps you make beautiful color scheme based Flutter themes, using optional color branded
surfaces. The created themes are based on the same concept as Flutter's newer `ColorScheme` based themes,
but with a few interesting twists and features.

The package is now available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/flex_color_scheme) as pre-release dev version.
Documentation is still being improved and there are some pending API changes planned before 1.0.0 release.

The package documentation contain five different examples that will be available as live Web versions.

### Live WEB versions of the FlexColorScheme examples in the pub.dev package

The examples start with the most simple case and increase in complexity a bit. The last example,
number 5 has almost everything that you can also see and try in the Flexfold web demo app.

[**Try example 1**](https://rydmike.com/flexcolorscheme1)
Use a built-in scheme as your application theme and toggle between its light and dark variant, or allow device mode
setting to control if the dark or light theme is used.

[**Try example 2**](https://rydmike.com/flexcolorscheme2)
Like the previous example, but here we use custom colors to make a custom scheme and turn it into a theme.

[**Try example 3**](https://rydmike.com/flexcolorscheme3)
In this example we can toggle the active theme between 3 different predefined color schemes, plus the custom
one we made in the previous example.

[**Try example 4**](https://rydmike.com/flexcolorscheme4)
In example 4 we can toggle between all the different built in themes.

[**Try example 5**](https://rydmike.com/flexcolorscheme5)
The last and most complex example presents more configuration options that you can modify interactively.
This example is best seen and tested on a tablet, desktop or desktop web browser, rather than on a phone, but it
certainly works on a phone sized canvas too. This example is explained in more detail further below.

### Other demos

Here is a link to tweet with some more [FlexColorScheme demos](https://twitter.com/RydMike/status/1318461741584601088?s=20)

The Flexfold web demo app also uses the FlexColorScheme package for its theming.
Since Flexfold has a bit more surface area that uses color branded surfaces it looks
a bit cooler than the above demos, but it is using exactly the same themes via the
FlexColorScheme package. But yeah it can look really nice, like shown here

To play with the themes in the Flexfold app, just head over to the [Flexfold demo](https://rydmike.com/demoflexfold) and go to themes.
