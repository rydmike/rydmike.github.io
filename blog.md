## Flutter Santa's Blog

I will start to write more about Flutter, but probably only as simple markup files in this site. 
Well who knows, maybe I will make some cross posts on other sites too. 
We will see, but for now you can find Flutter Santa's rumblings here.

Occasionally I also publish Flutter Gists that you can try in DartPad. The Gists were typically made
to present something that did not look quite right. Sometimes they can be a Flutter 
example, snippet or a setup that I found useful and wanted to share in short Blog like format,
and also document it. This way I can find it myself when I need it again. Generally my
more or less documented Flutter Gists can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/rydmike). 

Chill, peace and **Flutter** love to all of you! ðŸ’™
