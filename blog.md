## Flutter Santa's Blog

I plan to try to write a bit more about Flutter, but not so frequently and probably just as simple
md files in this site. Well who knows, maybe I will make some cross posts on other sites too. 
We will see, but for now you can find my Flutter Santa's blog like rumblings here.

Occasionally I also publish Flutter Gists that you can try in DartPad. The Gists were typically made
to present something that did not look quite right. Sometimes they can be a Flutter 
example, snippet or a setup that I found useful and wanted to share in short Blog like format,
and also document it. This way I can find it myself when I need it again. Generally my
more or less documented Flutter Gists can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/rydmike). 

**Chill, Peace and Flutter love to ya all!** 💙
