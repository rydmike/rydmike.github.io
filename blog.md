# Flutter Santa's Blog

I sometimes write blog like articles about Flutter and publish them here. Who knows, maybe I will make some cross posts on other sites too, some rainy day. We will see, but for now you can find Flutter Santa's rumblings here.

Occasionally I also publish Flutter Gists that you can try in DartPad. The Gists might be a Flutter example, snippet, issue or a setup that I found useful and wanted to share in short Blog like format, and also document it. This way I can find it myself when I need it again. Generally my more or less documented Flutter Gists can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/rydmike). 

Chill, peace and Flutter love to you all! ðŸ’™
