## Flexfold

Flexfold is a responsive scaffold package for Flutter. A live web demo of an app using the package can be [tried here](http://rydmike.com/demoflexfold). It is my intention to open source this demo application when the Flexfold package has been published.

A key feature of the Flexfold Scaffold is that navigation mode changes animates, as demonstrated below.

If desired the animations can be customized to make it really wild, not really recommended for an app, but it looks cool in a demo.

The live demo app uses the [DevicePreview package](https://pub.dev/packages/device_preview), so the defined responsive behavior can be tested on different device approximations.

A Tweet thread presenting and explaining key Flexfold features with a series of animated GIFs is [available here](https://twitter.com/RydMike/status/1308281235723055107?s=20).

The beta version of the Flutter package is ready, but it has not been published on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev) yet, it is still pending documentation.

If you try the [Flexfold web demo](http://rydmike.com/demoflexfold) you can notice that on the Settings page, all the settings have tooltips that explain the API used to control each setting. The tooltips can alo be turned OFF, as they tend to get in the way if you do not need them.
