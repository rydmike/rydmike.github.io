## Flexfold

**Flexfold** is a responsive and adaptive Scaffold package for Flutter. A live web demo of an example app using the 
package can be seen [**tested here**](http://rydmike.com/demoflexfold). It is my intention to
open source this demo application after the **Flexfold package** itself has been published.

A beta version of the Flutter **Flexfold package** is being used in this demo, but it has not been published 
on [**pub.dev**](https://pub.dev) yet, it is still pending documentation. Some Flutter APIs it is using are also
not yet available on Flutter's stable channel. To avoid releasing separate versions, one for the 
stable channel and another one for the beta/dev/master channels, it is being held back until the used APIs land in 
the stable channel too. **OK, you got me**, it's really the darn docs that I have not had time to complete. 

### Flexfold in Action

A key feature of the **Flexfold** scaffold is that navigation mode changes are animated as shown below.

If desired the animations can be customized to make it really wild, not necessarily recommended for a real app, 
but it looks cool in a demo.

### Flexfold and DevicePreview 

The Flexfold demo app uses the wonderful [**DevicePreview package**](https://pub.dev/packages/device_preview) by 
[Alo√Øs Deniel](https://twitter.com/aloisdeniel), this makes it possible to test and verify configured 
responsive behavior on different device approximations.

### Flexfold API Tooltips

When you try the [Flexfold demo app](http://rydmike.com/demoflexfold) you will notice that on the Settings page,
all the settings have tooltips that show the API used to control the setting and its current value. 
This feature in the demo app is an interactive way to help you find the right Flexfold API and value, 
to configure its behavior in a way that fits your use case.

The tooltips in the demo app can be turned OFF via yet another setting. Generally tooltips tend to get
in the way when you are very familiar with an app and no longer need them. I always recommend implementing a global
tooltip toggle offered to users in advanced settings. Flexfold support this by offering an API for turning OFF all
tooltips used in the package.

### Flexfold Feature Demos

A walk through of Flexfold's features can be found in this
[**Tweet thread**](https://twitter.com/RydMike/status/1308281235723055107). It uses animated GIF screen recordings
to show the impact of the most frequently used settings.

### Flexfold does Undraw 

There are some playful extras in the **Flexfold demo** app that are not really relevant 
to the **Flexfold package**. One such thing are the lovely [**Undraw**](https://undraw.co/) SVG drawings made by 
[**Katerina Limpitsouni**](https://twitter.com/ninaLimpi). In the demo app they change color and are themed to match
the color of the primary color of selected [**FlexColorScheme**](https://rydmike.com/colorscheme) based theme.
Like the theme changes in Flutter, the colors also animate in the SVG drawings while theme changes.

The SVG drawings also animate in and out between a few selected ones related to the page they are on. 
The display order is random between the ones that are included for each page. On the **Slivers** page in the 
demo we go nuts and display hundreds of Undraw SVGs, where each one gets a random color and is animated in/out to
another random image at random time intervals. This is just a wild test to stress Flutter on different platforms,
especially on Web. I doubt it is really relevant to any real world use case, nevertheless it is interesting to
see that it actually works. On desktop it is actually quite smooth in release builds, in Web builds it is a bit janky,
but works.

### Flexfold goes Plasma

Last but not least of the wild things, is a toggle that enables an animated **plasma background** effect on the side bar 
and Flexfold Home page. This plasma effect is something I found in [Felix Blaschke's](https://github.com/felixblaschke) 
[**simple_animations_package**](https://pub.dev/packages/simple_animations). He also has a Flutter web app
called [**Liquid Studio**](https://felixblaschke.github.io/liquid-studio/#/) where you can try it and design 
custom plasma effects.

The Plasma effects I used are defined in code and tied to the primary theme color and light/dark
mode, so that it always fits as a page background effect. It looks cooler in dark mode though.
