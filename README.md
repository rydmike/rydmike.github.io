## Flutter Demos by [@RydMike](https://twitter.com/RydMike)

On this [**GitHub** Pages](https://pages.github.com/) site I publish and present [**Flutter**](https://flutter.dev/)
web application demos. Some of the demos are related to Flutter packages I have published or am working on in my
free time.
  
I also go through selected Flutter issues that I have submitted, provide links to code samples and demos of them. 
These are selected cases with code samples that might be of more general interest than just the issue itself.
 
All the demos and samples here are published as single page web apps in sub-folders to this **GitHub** Pages site. 
Use the links in the above table to get to presentations of them, where you can learn more about each demo
and try it live.

My Twitter handle is [**@RydMike**](https://twitter.com/RydMike) and I Tweet 
almost exclusively about [**#Flutter**](https://twitter.com/RydMike/with_replies). 
I also use this site's **rydmike.com** domain as my verified package
[**publisher account**](https://pub.dev/publishers/rydmike.com/packages) 
on [**pub.dev**](https://pub.dev/).  

Welcome and I hope you enjoy the demos!

This website is just a simple collection of static markdown files converted to a website by GitHub Pages,
so don't expect any fancy features on the site pages itself, but the **Flutter apps** in the site's sub-folders are 
another story, they contain **pixie dust** and **Flutter magic**. 

>Sure, it would be nice with fancier layout, proper blog with comments for this site's pages too. So who knows,
>I might change the site content to a Flutter web application some day. It would be an interesting experiment
>to make a basic web content management system with Flutter, even if that is not one of Flutter's core strengths.
