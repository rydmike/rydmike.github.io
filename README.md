    I also use this domain 
    as as my [verified package publisher account](https://pub.dev/publishers/rydmike.com/packages) on 
    [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/). My Twitter handle is [@RydMike](https://twitter.com/RydMike) and I Tweet almost exclusively
    about [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/).

This website is just a simple markdown file converted to a **GitHub Pages** website by GitHub. It uses the 
default GitHub Jekyll Cayman theme. So don't expect any fancy features! I might change the content to a
Flutter web application some day. It would be an interesting experiment to make a simple web content 
management system with Flutter, even if that is not one of Flutter's core strengths.
