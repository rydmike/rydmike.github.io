## Flutter Demos by [@RydMike](https://twitter.com/RydMike)

This [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) website contains [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) Web app 
demos I have made, as well as repositories related to some of the Flutter issue reports I have submitted. 

The Flutter Web app demos have been published as single page web apps in this site as sub-folders to it. 
You can use the links in the above table to read more about them and try them out.

I also use this site's **rydmike.com** domain as my
[verified package publisher account](https://pub.dev/publishers/rydmike.com/packages) 
on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/). My Twitter handle is [@RydMike](https://twitter.com/RydMike) and I Tweet 
almost exclusively about [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/). 

This website is just a simple markdown file converted to a website by GitHub, so don't expect any fancy features on
the site pages, but the Flutter apps in its sub-folder is another story. 

I might change the site content to a Flutter web application some day. It could be an interesting experiment
to make a simple web content management system with Flutter, even if that is not one of Flutter's core strengths.
