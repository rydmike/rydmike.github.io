### Flutter Demos by [@RydMike](https://twitter.com/RydMike)

> This **GitHub Pages** website contains WEB demos of **Flutter** packages, as well as repositories linked to Flutter issue reports. The demos have been published as single page web apps in the site sub-folders. They are presented and linked below for easy access.
>
> This site is just a simple markdown file converted to a **GitHub Pages** website by GitHub, it uses the default GitHub Jekyll Cayman theme. I might change the content later to a Flutter web application. It would be an interesting experiment to make a simple web content management system with Flutter, even if that is not one of Flutter's core strengths.

## [Flexfold](http://rydmike.com/demoflexfold)

Flexfold is a responsive scaffold package for Flutter. A live web demo of an app using the package can be [tried here](http://rydmike.com/demoflexfold). It is my intention to open source this demo application when the Flexfold package has been published.

A key feature of the Flexfold Scaffold is that navigation mode changes animates, as demonstrated below.

If desired the animations can be customized to make it really wild, not really recommended for an app, but it looks cool in a demo.

The live demo app uses the [DevicePreview package](https://pub.dev/packages/device_preview), so the defined responsive behavior can be tested on different device approximations.

A Tweet thread presenting and explaining key Flexfold features with a series of animated GIFs is [available here](https://twitter.com/RydMike/status/1308281235723055107?s=20).

The beta version of the Flutter package is ready, but it has not been published on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev) yet, it is still pending documentation.

If you try the [Flexfold web demo](http://rydmike.com/demoflexfold) you can notice that on the Settings page, all the settings have tooltips that explain the API used to control each setting. The tooltips can alo be turned OFF, as they tend to get in the way if you do not need them.
