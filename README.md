## Flutter Demos by [@RydMike](https://twitter.com/RydMike)

On this GitHub Pages based website I publish and present [**Flutter**](https://flutter.dev/)
web application demos. Some demos are related to Flutter packages I have published and work on in my
free time.

All the demos and live samples here are published as single page web apps in
sub-folders to this GitHub Pages site. Use the above links table to learn more
and try them out.

I also go through selected Flutter issues that I have submitted, provide links
to code samples and demos of them. These are selected cases with code samples 
that might be of more general interest than just the issue itself.

My Twitter handle is [**@RydMike**](https://twitter.com/RydMike) and I tweet 
almost exclusively about [**#Flutter**](https://twitter.com/RydMike/with_replies). 
I also use this website's **rydmike.com** domain as my verified package
[**publisher account**](https://pub.dev/publishers/rydmike.com/packages) 
on [**pub.dev**](https://pub.dev/).  

### Public Projects

My three main **public** Flutter projects are [**FlexColorPicker**](colorpicker), [**FlexColorScheme**](colorscheme)
and [**Flexfold**](flexfold).

The first two are published as reusable packages [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/), and 
have live Flutter web examples demonstrating their usage. Flexfold is a work in 
progress and on hold for the moment. There is a live web demo of it, showing 
its features in detail, but it is not yet available as a public package.

Welcome, and enjoy the demos!

This website is just a simple collection of static markdown files converted to a website by GitHub Pages,
so don't expect any fancy features on the site's pages itself, but the demo apps in the site's sub-folders are 
another story, they contain **pixie dust** and **Flutter magic**. 

> Sure, it would be nice with a fancier layout, proper blog with comments for this site's pages too. So who knows,
> I might change the site content to a Flutter web application some day. It would be an interesting experiment
> to make a basic web content management system with Flutter, even if that is not one of Flutter's core strengths.
