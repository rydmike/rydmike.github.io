### Flutter Demos by [@RydMike](https://twitter.com/RydMike)

>This **GitHub Pages** website contains demos and tests of various **Flutter** packages and projects, as well as repositories linked to Flutter issue reports. The apps, demos and issue support demos have been published as single page web apps in site sub-folders. They are presented and linked below for easy access.

>This site is just a simple markdown file converted to a **GitHub Pages** website by GitHub, it even uses the default GitHub Jekyll theme. Eventually I will change the content, maybe to a Flutter web application. It could be an interesting experiment to make a simple web content management system with Flutter, even if that is not one of Flutter's core strengths.

## [Flexfold](http://rydmike.com/demoflexfold)

Flexfold is a responsive scaffold package for Flutter. A live web demo of an app using the package can be [played with here](http://rydmike.com/demoflexfold). It is my intention to open source this demo application when Flexfold is ready.

A key feature of the Flexfold Scaffold is that navigation mode changes animates.

If desired the animations can be customized to make it really wild, not really recommended for an app, but it looks cool in a demo.

The live demo app uses the [DevicePreview package](https://pub.dev/packages/device_preview), so the defined responsive behavior can be tested on different device approximations.

A Tweet thread presenting key Flexfold features with a series of animated GIFs is [available here](https://twitter.com/RydMike/status/1308281235723055107?s=20).

The beta version of the Flutter package is ready, but it has not been published on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev) yet, it is still pending documentation.
