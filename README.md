## Flutter Demos by [@RydMike](https://twitter.com/RydMike)

On this [**GitHub** Pages](https://pages.github.com/) site I publish and present [**Flutter**](https://flutter.dev/)
web application demos. Some demos are related to Flutter packages I have published, or that I am still working on.
  
I also go through some selected Flutter issues that I submitted, provide links to code samples and demos of them. 
These are selected cases with code samples that might be of more general interest, than just the issue itself.
 
All demos and samples have been published as single page web apps in sub-folders to this **GitHub** Pages site. 
To find the examples, use the links in the above table, where you can read more about them and try them out.

I also use this site's **rydmike.com** domain as my verified package
[**publisher account**](https://pub.dev/publishers/rydmike.com/packages) 
on [**pub.dev**](https://pub.dev/).

My Twitter handle is [**@RydMike**](https://twitter.com/RydMike) and I Tweet 
almost exclusively about [**#Flutter**](https://twitter.com/RydMike/with_replies). 

This website is just a simple collection of static markdown files converted to a website by GitHub,
so don't expect any fancy features on the site pages, but the **Flutter apps** in the site's sub-folders are 
another story, they contain pixie dust and **Flutter magic**. 

>Sure, it would be nice with fancier layout, proper blog with comments for this site's pages too. So who knows,
>I might change the site content to a Flutter web application some day. It would be an interesting experiment
>to make a basic web content management system with Flutter, even if that is not one of Flutter's core strengths.


Welcome and I hope you enjoy the demos!
