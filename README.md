## Flutter Demos by [@RydMike](https://twitter.com/RydMike)

This [**GitHub Pages**](https://pages.github.com/) website contains [**Flutter**](https://flutter.dev/) Web app 
demos I've made. It also presents some of the Flutter issues I have submitted and provides links to the issue samples 
for cases that contained code snippets that might be of more general interest.   
 
The Flutter Web app demos have been published as single page web apps in this site as sub-folders to it. 
You can use the links in the above table to read more about the demos and try them out.

I also use this site's **rydmike.com** domain as my
verified package [**publisher account**](https://pub.dev/publishers/rydmike.com/packages) 
on [**pub.dev**](https://pub.dev/). My Twitter handle is [**@RydMike**](https://twitter.com/RydMike) and I Tweet 
almost exclusively about [**#Flutter**](https://twitter.com/RydMike/with_replies). 

This website is just a simple markdown file converted to a website by GitHub, so don't expect any fancy features on
the site pages, but the **Flutter apps** in the site's sub-folders is another story. 

>Sure it would be nice with fancier layout, proper blog with comments for the site pages. Who knows, I might change the

>web content management system with Flutter, even if that is not one of Flutter's core strengths.
