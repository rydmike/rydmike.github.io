# Flutter App Theming
*(May 19, 2022)*

On May 17,2022 at Flutter Nordics meetup at Wolt HQ, I had the pleasure of talking
about theming Flutter applications and the state of Material 3 design in Flutter 3.0.
In the talk I cover topics like:

* Flutter theming
* Right way to make ThemeData
* M3 ColorScheme
* Seeded ColorScheme
* Material 3 features in Flutter 3.0
* Theme extensions
* Easier theming with FlexColorScheme 

## Video and Slide deck

The slides are available as Google Slides here:

https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1JRQ3w1UPSlqfaW_pbBJrzjNOQnxEcRfGkbMF0Mwtr98/present?slide=id.p1

The presentation was streamed live and is available as a recording on YouTube.

Part one here: https://youtu.be/M6Uz4ALs2kc?t=2920

And second part here: https://youtu.be/M6Uz4ALs2kc?t=7209

## Demo app

The talk uses a demo app to show the different ways to construct a ThemeData object.
The same app is also used in the presentation to show what changes in Flutter 3.0 
when you switch to using Material 3 design by setting `useMateria3` to true in 
`ThemeData`
