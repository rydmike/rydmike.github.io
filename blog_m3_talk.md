# Flutter App Theming

On May 17,2022 at Flutter Nordics meetup at Wolt HQ, I had the pleasure of talking about theming Flutter applications and the state of Material 3 design in Flutter 3.0.

### Demo App Used in the Talk

The talk uses a simple demo app to show different ways to construct a `ThemeData` object. The same app is also used in the presentation to show what changes in Flutter 3.0, when you switch to using Material 3 design, by setting `useMaterial3` to true in 
`ThemeData`. This demo app is available as single [Gist file on GitHub](https://gist.github.com/rydmike/515a014525c91ec55c86b489c30bfad5), it can be run directly in DartPad here:

## Talk by Eralp Karaduman
Between my two part talk, you can find a very interesting presentation by [Eralp Karaduman](https://twitter.com/eralpkaraduman) about
**Mocking APIs using embedded web servers in Flutter apps**.
