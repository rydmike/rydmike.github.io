# Flutter Linting Comparison
*(Published July 28, 2021, Updated May 21, 2022)*

> Updated to cover Flutter 3.0 and Dart 2.17 linters.

At the end of this article I present a comparison of Flutter default linting and popular packages, comparing the Dart and Flutter lint rules they use.

[<img src="https://rydmike.com/assets/lint_compare.png?raw=true" alt="lint_compare" width="400"/>](#what-are-the-rule-differences-between-all-these-packages)

## What Is the Dart Linter?

The Dart linter is a static analyzer for identifying possible problems in your Dart source code. There are over two hundred code linting rules available, checking anything from potential type issues, coding style, proper Flutter widget usage and formatting.

You can set up the Dart analyzer and linter to do your bidding the way you like it. Some rules are more important than others, and some are just style and personal preference related, the kind that developers like to debate forever. When it comes to them, there is no real right or wrong, do what you prefer if a certain style is not mandated in your project.

Enabling very strict linting rules on a code base that previously did not use it, can be time-consuming. For such cases, gradually introducing more stringent lint rules is a good idea. To do that, you may want to get to know the lint rules better and how to set them up yourself, without using a package. 

Many Dart analyzer and linting errors can also be automatically fixed by using `dart fix`. This also works with many lint rules when you enable a rule in a project that did previously not use it. See the docs for more info on how to use [dart fix](https://dart.dev/tools/dart-fix). If there is `dart fix` for a given lint rule, then using it to migrate a code base to use it, is a big time saver.

To study and read more about each lint rule, you can head over to the [Linter for Dart](https://dart-lang.github.io/linter/lints/) site.

## How Do I Use the Dart Linter?

Personally I like to start by enabling all lint rules in one file, and then including it in my `analysis_options.yaml` file. I simply call this file `all_lint_rules.yaml`. You can get the latest official and always up-to-date version of all lint rules [here](https://dart-lang.github.io/linter/lints/options/options.html), grab its content and put it in a file called `all_lint_rules.yaml`.

If you do not want to track the Dart lint site for updates to all available lint rules, there is also an excellent package made by [GaÃ«tan Schwartz @gaetschwartz](https://github.com/gaetschwartz) called [all_lint_rules_community](https://pub.dev/packages/all_lint_rules_community) that you can use to add all lint rules to your project, instead of adding and updating the file manually. The package is automatically updated when new lint rules are added to the Dart [all lint rules page](https://dart-lang.github.io/linter/lints/options/options.html), so all you have to do is bump the package version to get the latest list of all lint rules when the package has been updated. 

Both the `analysis_options.yaml` and the `all_lint_rules.yaml` are placed in the root of your Flutter project folder, same place where you have your `pubspec.yaml` file. In my `analysis_options.yaml` I include the `all_lint_rules.yaml` file. In my `analysis_options.yaml` I also exclude some commonly generated Dart files from being analyzed.

I use the new Dart `language:` setting, where I set `strict-casts: true`, `strict-inference: true`, and `strict-raw-types: true`. These settings replace previous `strong-mode` settings `implicit-casts: false` and `implicit-dynamic: false`. See Dart documentation [Enabling stricter type checks](https://dart.dev/guides/language/analysis-options#enabling-additional-type-checks) for more information. I highly recommend using these settings. 

I lift common mistakes that I think should be errors, to **error** level. Then the analyzer won't even let me compile code with these mistakes present. These include setting it to flag missing return and missing required parameters as errors, not as warnings or info. I keep parameter re-assignments as only a warning, there are occasions when it may be needed, but I want a warning, so I can consider a rewrite of it, or on a case by case ignore the warning rule after consideration.

My `analysis_options.yaml` file starts like this:


```yaml
# RydMike LINTER Preferences v2.0.0
#
# Get this file here: https://gist.github.com/rydmike/fdb53ddd933c37d20e6f3188a936cd4c

    deprecated_member_use_from_same_package: ignore

    # DON'T assign new values to parameters of methods or functions.
    # https://dart-lang.github.io/linter/lints/parameter_assignments.html
    parameter_assignments: warning

    # Allow having TODOs in the code.
    todo: ignore

# LINTER Preferences
#
# Explicitly disable only the rules we do not want.
linter:
  rules:
```

The rest of the settings is just turning **OFF** linting rules I do not want to use. Since all rules are now **ON** by default, it is a list of rules that should NOT be used. I try to keep it relatively short.

As for what actually gets turned OFF, first there are some linting rules that conflict with each other. When it comes to them, you can go two ways. If you don't want to make a choice and want to be able to use both alternatives, then disable both rules. Alternatively choose one of them and disable the one you do not want to use. I prefer to make a choice, the conflicting rules are often highly opinionated. In certain scenarios it might be more lenient to allow both options. If it is a personal project, then go ahead and use what you prefer.

A typical example of a personal preference linting rule, is the `prefer_double_quotes` versus `prefer_single_quotes` choice. Even if a linting rule is highly opinionated, in large project you may still want to make choice to enforce a consistent style.

Here is my choice and my rationale on the quote style:

```yaml
    # DO use double quotes where they wouldn't require additional escapes.
    #
    # https://dart-lang.github.io/linter/lints/prefer_double_quotes.html
    #
    # This rule is mostly about what style you want to use and enforce, if any.
    # It of course conflicts with rule:
    # `prefer_single_quotes` : "DO use single quotes where they wouldn't require additional escapes."
    # https://dart-lang.github.io/linter/lints/prefer_single_quotes.html
    #
    # For us single quotes are easier to type. On our ISO keyboards it is next to Enter key, and
    # we don't need the Shift plus the far to reach nr 2 key on R1 to type it. Also, we don't think
    # they compromise on readability.
    # Then again if you don't care and don't mind mixing and matching, then ALSO
    # turning OFF `prefer_single_quotes` works fine too, and then you can use both options.
    #
    # We thought it was cleaner to stick to one style. Single quotes are easier to type for us,
    # thus we turn OFF this `prefer_double_quotes` rule. There is another lint rules that recommends you
    # to use double quotes when you otherwise would need to escape the single quote char, it works
    # well when you use the prefer_single_quotes rule as well.
    #
    # Other known linters use:
    #
    # Core           disabled : https://pub.dev/packages/lints
    # Recommended    disabled : https://pub.dev/packages/lints
    # Flutter Lints  disabled : https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_lints
    # Pedantic       disabled : https://pub.dev/packages/pedantic
    # Effective Dart disabled : https://pub.dev/packages/effective_dart
    # Flutter repo   disabled : https://github.com/flutter/flutter/blob/master/analysis_options.yaml

    prefer_double_quotes: false
```

In addition to things that conflict with their own counter-part, what else do I turn off? As little as possible, I prefer things pretty strict, but that is just my personal preference. 

I documented the choices I made, and the reasoning behind the choices at the point in time when I made them. I vary it slightly depending on if I am using linting for a package or an app, keeping it even stricter for public packages. These options and selections are also documented.

[Here is a Gist](https://gist.github.com/rydmike/fdb53ddd933c37d20e6f3188a936cd4c) with the full details of the settings I use in `analysis_options.yaml` for my personal projects.

I might change a few settings as things evolve. One rule I found myself disliking and disabling, is the `sort_constructors_first`. Sounds like it is a fine rule, right? For the default un-named constructor I agree, I want it first too. There is a separate lint for that, that I do use, it is called `sort_unnamed_constructors_first`. However, **after that** I want to see all the properties of the default constructor, with their documentation comments. I find this useful for more complex classes that may have many named constructors or factories with a lot of named parameters.

If the `sort_constructors_first` rule is enabled, I am forced to use an order where I have to scroll far down to find the properties much further below, after all the named constructors and factories. I find this very inconvenient. This is another minor example of personal style preference. There are many lint rules that are style and code consistency related. Get to know them and find your own personal preferences.

When you disable a lint rule, try to write a short note to your future self why you disabled it. This is what I wrote down concerning why I turned off the `sort_constructors_first` rule. The good thing is you can certainly change your mind about a rule's usefulness or add more as you need, well at least in your personal projects.

```yaml
    # DO sort constructor declarations before other members.
    #
    # We do like this lint rule, but we want to have the default constructor first, followed
    # by its properties, after this other named constructors and factories. This rule gets
    # in the way of that and forces you to put (often final) constructor properties after all
    # the named constructors and factories, making them tedious to find and disconnected from
    # where we want to see, read and handily edit them. This is especially the case if there are
    # many constructors and factories, and they have a lot of parameters. For now, we disable
    # this rule and order things as described above, which apart from the default constructor
    # properties coming right after the constructor, is the only part where we in practice
    # deviate from this rule, so other yes, we do put constructors first as well anyway.
    #
    # Other known linters use:
    #
    # Core           disabled : https://pub.dev/packages/lints
    # Recommended    disabled : https://pub.dev/packages/lints
    # Flutter Lints  disabled : https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_lints
    # Pedantic       disabled : https://pub.dev/packages/pedantic
    # Effective Dart disabled : https://pub.dev/packages/effective_dart
    # Flutter repo   enabled  : https://github.com/flutter/flutter/blob/master/analysis_options.yaml
    # Lint           disabled : https://pub.dev/packages/lint
    #                           Discussion https://github.com/passsy/dart-lint/issues/1
    # VG Analysis    enabled  : https://pub.dev/packages/very_good_analysis
    # RydMike        disabled : https://gist.github.com/rydmike/fdb53ddd933c37d20e6f3188a936cd4c
    sort_constructors_first: false
```

The above is also an example of the documentation style I use for all lint rules that I turned OFF. Yes it is verbose, but now I can find my past reasoning for the choice I made. I can also directly see references to what others have chosen as their lint preference for each rule that I do not use.

## Which Linting Package Should I Use?

If I want to use linting based on a package, which linting package should I use? Answering this question got a lot easier when Flutter 2.5 was released. 

Starting from Flutter version 2.5, Flutter and Dart use two new linting packages that are **enabled by default** when you create a new Flutter project. With the launch of Flutter 3, the used linting packages were updated to version 2, and include more Dart related rules than the rule set in version 1. When you create a new Flutter project with Flutter version 3.0.0 or later, you get version 2 linting rules enabled by default.

If you created your Flutter project with Flutter 2.5 or later, you are already using the default linting package. This is a perfectly good starting point. Further below you can compare Dart and Flutter default enabled rules to popular 3rd party packages.

## What About Using a Third Party Linting Package?

If you want to use a third party linting package, you can do so. There are many 3rd party packages that define linting rules for you. There is nothing wrong with using 3rd party linting packages if they fit your needs. Using a ready-made linting package may be the right choice for you, especially if you are not interested in getting to know the rules yourself and follow-up on new rules that are added by the Dart team occasionally, then please do use a package. 

For my personal projects I prefer the clarity of enabling all rules in one file, and then disabling the ones that do not fit my use case and preferences. Earlier I started with a package too, but I noticed that when I needed or wanted to modify a few rules. I then ended up with **enabling or disabling** rules in relation to used package settings. This got a bit messy to keep track of. Eventually it felt cleaner to just turn everything ON, and then just have OFF definitions in my `analysis_options.yaml`. Super simple, clear and easy to modify when needed, without messing things up. Plus no need for a package for this relatively simple setup.

In a big project the lint rules have probably been agreed and defined already for you, then just stick to that. If you find that the lint rules have not been defined, nor documented why they are a certain way in the project, well then they really should be, maybe something to address.

In the past [Effective Dart](https://pub.dev/packages/effective_dart) and [Pedantic](https://pub.dev/packages/pedantic) used to be very popular. However both packages have been **deprecated**. For a new project, do not use them, and consider migrating applications and packages that used them, to recommended alternatives. 

The Pedantic package from Google was originally intended mostly for their internal use. Despite its name, it was not very strict nor pedantic at all. It was used as a minimum set they could agree on internally for Dart projects. 

The Effective Dart package, before it was deprecated, was a way to provide analysis options corresponding to the guidelines in [Effective Dart](https://dart.dev/guides/language/effective-dart) documentation.

I still include both these deprecated packages in my comparison table, so that you can see how they compare rule set wise to currently commonly used linting rule set.

### Lints

The first Flutter and Dart default used linting package is called [**lints**](https://pub.dev/packages/lints). It was launched as version 1.0.0 on May 12, 2021. This package contains the new official recommended selection of lint rules for **Dart** projects. With release of Dart 2.17.0 and Flutter 3, it was bumped to version 2.0.0, enabling more and new rules.

It comes in two flavors, the absolute minimum lints, called **Core lints**, and a broader set called **Recommended lints**. The recommended set also includes the core lints. In the Dart guide you can read more about it [here](https://dart.dev/guides/language/analysis-options#enabling-linter-rules).

In its latest version, **Lints Core** enables 28 lint rules, that is only 13.8% of available rules, only the most critical Dart rules. The **Lints Recommended** set enables 84 rules, or 41.4% of available highly recommended Dart rules.

### Flutter lints

The second out of the box used package is called [**Flutter lints**](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_lints). It was also launched as version 1.0.0 on May 12, 2021. The `flutter_lints` package includes the **recommended set** from Dart `lints`, plus a few more rules that are **very important** in Flutter projects. These Dart and Flutter lint rule sets, are built as supersets with increasing amount of rules enabled. Flutter lints includes all Lints recommended rules, that then includes all Lints core rules.

Starting from Flutter version stable 2.5.0 and later versions, the package `flutter_lints` defines the latest set of officially recommended lints that encourage good coding practices for **Flutter** apps, packages, and plugins. In its latest version Flutter lints enables 97 rules, or 47.8% of available linting rules.

Projects created with **flutter create** using Flutter 2.5.0 and later, are automatically setup to use the **Flutter lints** package. When creating a Flutter project with Flutter 3.0.0 or later, the used `flutter_lints` linting package level is bumped to version 2.0.0, that also uses `lints` 2.0.0. 

You can find its usage and setup instructions [here](https://flutter.dev/docs/release/breaking-changes/flutter-lints-package).

Since these are included as default linting packages for new Flutter projects, there is no major reason to recommend any other linter package than [`flutter_lints`](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_lints) as a general good starting point. **However**, if you want use more and stricter rules, there are two very good options, in addition to rolling your own setup.

### Lint and Very Good Analysis

Both [**Lint**](https://pub.dev/packages/lint) and [**Very Good Analysis** (VGA)](https://pub.dev/packages/very_good_analysis) are very solid choices offering much tighter linting rule sets than Flutter lints.

They both enable more and stricter lint rules than the default **flutter_lints** does. Both `lint` and `very_good_analysis` use strong mode and disable implicit casts. Very Good Analysis also wisely opts to disable implicit dynamic. 

Neither of the packages have when this was written been updated to use the new Dart `language:` setting, with `strict-casts: true`, `strict-inference: true`, and `strict-raw-types: true`. These settings replace previous `strong-mode` settings `implicit-casts: false` and `implicit-dynamic: false`. See Dart documentation [Enabling stricter type checks](https://dart.dev/guides/language/analysis-options#enabling-additional-type-checks) for more information. The Flutter SDK repository for example uses the newer `language` settings. It is recommended to use them over the older `strong-mode` settings, that based on the Dart documentation are deprecated. Most likely Lint and VGA will be updated in the near future to do so too.

From its 2.3.0 version Very Good Analysis, started treating missing required parameters and missing return, as code errors. I consider this a wise and welcome addition. From version 1.8.1 the **lint** package does this as well, it even adds treating function parameter new value assignments as warnings, bringing its strictness even higher than VGA in this respect. 

The **lint** package includes excellent reasoning documentation for its lint rule choices in the source, allowing you to read and understand the author's rationale for the used choices. It also comes with a variant for packages, adding a few more useful rules for public packages. This is a good feature if you write packages. Some rules are not so useful, or even get in the way when you write applications, but are important when you write packages to help your package get a higher score on pub.dev. 

Out of the packaged linters **very_good_analysis**, enables the highest number of lint rules of the compared packaged linters. With 177 rules, or 87.2% of available lint rules enabled in package version 3.0.0, it is the most strict and pedantic of the compared packaged linters. The **lint** package is not far behind. With its 1.8.2 version, it is at 152 rules, or 74.9% of available lint rules enabled. 

Both packages track development of new Dart and Flutter lint rules well and are updated regularly. They both enable all critical and important rules. Both are excellent choices if you want stricter linting than Flutter offers out of the box, and don't want to track and maintain the used rule set yourself, and would rather just update a package dependency to update your linting game. 

If I would not use and prefer a custom setup, I might choose **very_good_analysis** over **lint**, mostly because it is stricter, and also because it is perhaps a bit more actively maintained. It for example adopted new Flutter 3 and Dart 2.17 linting rules quicker. The **lint** package is also very strict, just not the strictest, it tires to find the right balance between useful and annoying, this might fit your preferences better.

### Flutter Repository

I also find it interesting to follow what linting rules the Flutter SDK repository uses. During the past year there has been many new rules enabled in the Flutter SDK as well. Compared an older version 1.4.0 (September 10, 2021) of my comparison table, to the current version of it 2.0.0 (May 21, 2022), the Flutter repository (master channel) has gone from 129 enabled rules (67.2%), to 152 (74.9%) enabled lint rules. 

An interesting choice it has always used, and that I personally like, is the `always_specify_types` rule. This makes code very verbose, thus few developers like it. Its advantage is that it makes reading unfamiliar code easier, especially e.g. on GitHub where you can't use the IDE to peek at the type information.

### Compare and Choose

You can use my comparison table to compare Dart and Flutter default linting, to both past and currently popular linting packages, as well as the Flutter repository itself. See each rule they enable, and make your own preferred choice based on it.

If you want to stay on top of your linting rule setup yourself, then do as I do, roll your own linting rule configuration! Mostly I do this to use even stricter lint rules than current package linters offer, and also to make the opinionated choices I prefer. Most lint packages on purpose avoid making any choice for you when it comes to highly opinionated personal preferences rules.

I also like the clean setup of enabling all rules in one file, by include all currently available rules and then only turning OFF the rules I don't use. This keeps the setup easy to maintain. Feel free to do the same **or** take the easy route and just use default [Flutter lints](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_lints) or walk the narrow and strict path with [Very Good Analysis](https://pub.dev/packages/very_good_analysis) or [Lint](https://pub.dev/packages/lint).

If you don't care about linting and tuning it yourself, the nice part is that a good basic linting setup is a part of Flutter. From Flutter version 2.5 and later you get a solid rule set enabled by default for new projects. It is a smart move by the Flutter team to offer this. It means that eventually all Flutter projects will use good linting rules by default, rules that will help improve the quality of produced Flutter apps and packages. Since we are now at Flutter 3.0, this goal has already been realized to a large degree.

## What Are the Rule Differences Between All These Packages?

What are the lint rule differences between all these packages? That is a **very** good question. I guess I saved the most interesting part in this blog for last. I was very curious about this as well, so I went through **all** the lint settings for the following lint packages and setups:

| Lint style   | Previous             |  % of rules | Used now | +/- | % of rules |
| ----         | ----                   | ---- | ---- | ---- |  ---- |
|[Dart Core *(v2.0.0)*](https://pub.dev/packages/lints) | 26 | 13.5%| 28 | +2 | 13.8% |
|[Dart Recommended *(v2.0.0)*](https://pub.dev/packages/lints) | 74 | 38.5% | 84 | +10 | 41.4% |    
|[Flutter lints *(v1.0.4)*](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_lints) | 85 | 44.3% | 97 | +12 | 47.8 % | 
|[Pedantic *(v1.11.1) (Deprecated)*](https://pub.dev/packages/pedantic) | 52 | 27.1% | 52 | 0 | 25.6% |
|[Effective Dart *(v1.3.2) (Deprecated)*](https://pub.dev/packages/effective_dart) | 57 | 29.7% | 57 | 0 | 28.1% |
|[Flutter SDK repository *(master)*](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/blob/master/analysis_options.yaml) | 129 | 67.2% | 152 | +23 | 74.9% | 
|[Lint *(v1.8.2)*](https://pub.dev/packages/lint) | 147 | 76.6% | 152 | +5 | 74.9% |
|[Very Good Analysis *(v3.0.0)*](https://pub.dev/packages/very_good_analysis) | 153 | 79.7% | 177 | +24 | 87.2% |
|[RydMike - All ON, then turn OFF some *(v2.0.0)*](https://gist.github.com/rydmike/fdb53ddd933c37d20e6f3188a936cd4c) | 171 | 89.1%| 183 | +12 | 90.1% |
|[All LINT rules](https://dart-lang.github.io/linter/lints/options/options.html) | 192 | 100.0% | 203 | +11 | 100.0% |

The **previous** values refer to the number of enabled lint rules in comparison table version 1.4.0 from September 10, 2021, and rules **used now** in the latest lint rules comparison table, which is version 2.0.0, updated May 21, 2022.

Here is the full comparison in a [**Google Sheet**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Nc1gFjmCOMubWZD7f2E4fLhWN7LYaOE__tsA7bf2NjA), enjoy!

## More Code Analysis?

If you want to go even deeper into Dart code analysis, I recommend taking a look at [Dart Code Metrics](https://dartcodemetrics.dev/). A static analysis tool that helps you analyze and improve your Dart code quality. It collects analytical data on the code through calculating code metrics with configurable thresholds and provides additional rules for the Dart analyzer.
