## [Flexfold Demo](http://rydmike.com/demoflexfold)

Flexfold is a responsive scaffold package for Flutter. A live web demo of an app using the package can be [played with here](http://rydmike.com/demoflexfold). It is my intention to open source this demo application when Flexfold is ready.

A key feature of the Flexfold Scaffold is that navigation mode changes are animated.

If desired the animations can be customized to make it really wild, not really recommended for an app, but it looks cool in a demo.

The live demo app also incorporates the DevicePreview package, so the responsive behavior can be tested on different simulated devices.

A long Twitter thread presenting key Flexfold features with a series of animated GIFs is available [here](https://twitter.com/RydMike/status/1308281235723055107?s=20).

The beta version of the Flutter package is ready, but it has not been published on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev) yet, it is still pending documentation.
